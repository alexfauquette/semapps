# React-Admin components for markdown data display and input

## Installation

```bash
npm install @semapps/markdown-components --save
```

You also need to import this CSS file:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/react-mde@11.0.6/lib/styles/css/react-mde-all.css" />
```

## Development

### `npm run pre-publish`

Build the library in CommonJS and ES mode.
This command should always be run before publishing.

### `npm run dev`

Develop mode. Any change you make to a file in the `/src` directory will be immediately compiled.
